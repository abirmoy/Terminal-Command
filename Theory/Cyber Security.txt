Java Vulnerability
Java operates through an interpreter, the Java Virtual Machine 
(JVM). The JVM enables the Java program’s functionality. The 
JVM sandboxes or isolates untrusted code from the rest of the 
operating system. There are vulnerabilities, which allow 
untrusted code to go around the restrictions imposed by the 
sandbox. There are also vulnerabilities in the Java class library, 
which an application uses for its security. Java is the second 
biggest security vulnerability next to Adobe’s Flash plugin.

Authentication Methods
- Multi-factor Authentication - Mix of What You Know, What You Have, Who You Are
- What You Know - ex. Password
- What You Have - ex. Smartcard
- Who You Are - ex. Biometric Identifiers; There are two types of biometric identifiers:
Physiological characteristics – these include fingerprints, DNA, 
face, hands, retina, or ear features
Behavioral characteristics - include patterns of behavior, 
such as gestures, voice, typing rhythm, or the way a user walks

Virus
A virus is malicious executable code attached to another 
executable file, such as a legitimate program. Most viruses 
require end-user initiation, and can activate at a specific 
time or date. 

Malware
Malicious software, or malware, is a term used to describe 
software designed to disrupt computer operations, or gain access 
to computer systems, without the user's knowledge or permission. 
Malware has become an umbrella term used to describe all hostile 
or intrusive software. The term malware includes computer viruses, 
worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, 
and other malicious programs. Malware may be obvious and simple 
to identify or it can be very stealthy and almost impossible to 
detect.

Bot
From the word robot, a bot is malware designed to 
automatically perform action, usually online. While most 
bots are harmless, one increasing use of malicious bots 
are botnets. Several computers are infected with bots 
which are programmed to quietly wait for commands 
provided by the attacker.

Rootkit
This malware is designed to modify the operating 
system to create a backdoor. Attackers then use the backdoor 
to access the computer remotely. Most rootkits take advantage 
of software vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and 
modify system files. It is also common for rootkits to modify 
system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very 
hard to detect. Often, a computer infected by a rootkit 
must be wiped and reinstalled.

Worms
Worms are malicious code that replicates by independently 
exploiting vulnerabilities in networks. Worms usually slow down 
networks. Whereas a virus requires a host program to run, worms 
can run by themselves. Other than the initial infection, worms no 
longer require user participation. After a worm affects a host, 
it is able to spread very quickly over the network. 

Trojan horse
A Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations 
under the guise of a desired operation such as playing an online 
game. This malicious code exploits the privileges of the user 
that runs it. A Trojan horse differs from a virus because the 
Trojan binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, 
audio files, or games.

Logic Bombs
A logic bomb is a malicious program that uses a trigger to 
awaken the malicious code. For example, triggers can be dates, 
times, other programs running, or the deletion of a user account. 
The logic bomb remains inactive until that trigger event happens. 

Ransomware
Ransomware holds a computer system, or the data it contains, 
captive until the target makes a payment. Ransomware usually 
works by encrypting data in the computer with a key unknown to 
the user. The user must pay a ransom to the criminals to remove 
the restriction.

Spyware 
Spyware is software that enables a criminal to obtain information 
about a user’s computer activities. Spyware often includes 
activity trackers, keystroke collection, and data capture. 
In an attempt to overcome security measures, spyware often 
modifies security settings. Spyware often bundles itself with 
legitimate software or with Trojan horses. Many shareware 
websites are full of spyware.

Scareware 
Scareware persuades the user to take a specific action based on 
fear. Scareware forges pop-up windows that resemble operating 
system dialogue windows. These windows convey forged messages 
stating that the system is at risk or needs the execution of a 
specific program to return to normal operation. 



Vishing 
Vishing is phishing using voice communication technology. 
Criminals can spoof calls from legitimate sources using voice 
over IP (VoIP) technology. Victims may also receive a recorded 
message that appears legitimate. Criminals want to obtain credit 
card numbers or other information to steal the victim’s identity. 
Vishing takes advantage of the fact that people trust the 
telephone network.

Smishing 
Smishing (Short Message Service phishing) is phishing using text 
messaging on mobile phones. Criminals impersonate a legitimate 
source in an attempt to gain the trust of the victim. For example, 
a smishing attack might send the victim a website link. 
When the victim visits the website, malware is installed on the 
mobile phone.

Pharming
Pharming is the impersonation of a legitimate website in an effort 
to deceive users into entering their credentials. Pharming 
misdirects users to a fake website that appears to be official. 
Victims then enter their personal information thinking 
that they connected to a legitimate site.

Whaling
Whaling is a phishing attack that targets high profile targets 
within an organization such as senior executives. Additional 
targets include politicians or celebrities.

Bluejacking
Bluejacking is the term used for sending unauthorized messages 
to another Bluetooth device. A variation of this is 
to send a shocking image to the other device.

Man-In-The-Middle (MitM) 
MitM allows the attacker to take 
control over a device without the user’s knowledge. With that level 
of access, the attacker can intercept and capture user information 
before relaying it to its intended destination. MitM attacks are widely 
used to steal financial information. Many malware and techniques 
exist to provide attackers with MitM capabilities.

Man-In-The-Mobile (MitMo)
A variation of man-in-middle, MitMo 
is a type of attack used to take control over a mobile device. When 
infected, the mobile device can be instructed to exfiltrate 
user-sensitive information and send it to the attackers. ZeuS, 
an example of an exploit with MitMo capabilities, allows 
attackers quietly to capture 2-step verification SMS messages 
sent to users.

Zero-day attack
A zero-day attack, sometimes referred to as a zero-day threat, 
is a computer attack that tries to exploit software 
vulnerabilities that are unknown or undisclosed by the software 
vendor. The term zero hour describes 
the moment when someone discovers the exploit

Honeypots
A Honeypot is a behavior-based detection tool that first lures 
the attacker in by appealing to the attacker’s predicted pattern 
of malicious behavior, and then, when inside the honeypot, the 
network administrator can capture, log, and analyze the 
attacker’s behavior. This allows an administrator to gain more 
knowledge and build a better defense.

### The Kill Chain in Cyberdefense ###
In cybersecurity, the Kill Chain is the stages of an information systems 
attack. Developed by Lockheed Martin as a security framework for 
incident detection and response, the Cyber Kill Chain is comprised 
of the following stages:

Stage 1. Reconnaissance - The attacker gathers information 
about the target.

Stage 2. Weaponization - The attacker creates an exploit and 
malicious payload to send to the target.

Stage 3. Delivery - The attacker sends the exploit and malicious 
payload to the target by email or other method.

Stage 4. Exploitation - The exploit is executed.

Stage 5 Installation - Malware and backdoors are installed on the target.

Stage 6. Command and Control - Remote control of the target is gained 
through a command and control channel or server.

Stage 7. Action - The attacker performs malicious actions like 
information theft, or executes additional attacks on other devices 
from within the network by working through the Kill Chain stages again.

### NETFLOW ###
NetFlow technology is used to gather information about data flowing 
through a network. NetFlow information can be likened to a phone bill 
for your network traffic. It shows you who and what devices are in your 
network, as well as when and how users and devices accessed your 
network. NetFlow is an important component in behavior-based 
detection and analysis. Switches, routers, and firewalls equipped with 
NetFlow can report information about data entering, leaving, and travelling 
through the network. Information is sent to NetFlow Collectors that 
collect, store, and analyze NetFlow records.
NetFlow is able to collect information on usage through many different 
characteristics of how data is moved through the network. By collecting 
information about network data flows, NetFlow is able to establish 
baseline behaviors on more than 90 different attributes.

### Two Types of Encryption ###

Symmetric algorithms - These algorithms use the same pre-shared 
key, sometimes called a secret key pair, to encrypt and decrypt 
data. Both the sender and receiver know the pre-shared key before 
any encrypted communication begins. As shown in Figure 1, 
symmetric algorithms use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the 
plaintext. Encryption algorithms that use a common key are 
simpler and need less computational power.


Asymmetric algorithms - Asymmetrical encryption algorithms use 
one key to encrypt data and a different key to decrypt data. 
One key is public and the other is private. In a public-key 
encryption system, any person can encrypt a message using the 
public key of the receiver, and the receiver is the only one that 
can decrypt it using his private key. Parties exchange secure 
messages without needing a pre-shared key. 
Asymmetric algorithms are more complex. These algorithms are 
resource intensive and slower to execute.


Deterrent Controls
A deterrent is the opposite of a reward. A reward encourages 
individuals to do the right thing, while a deterrent discourages 
them from doing the wrong thing. Cyber security professionals and 
organizations use deterrents to limit or mitigate an action or 
behavior, but deterrents do not stop them. Access control 
deterrents discourage cyber criminals from gaining unauthorized 
access to information systems and sensitive data. Access control 
deterrents discourage attacking systems, stealing data, or 
spreading malicious code. Organizations use access control 
deterrents to enforce cybersecurity policies.
Deterrents make potential cyber criminals think twice before 
committing a crime. The figure lists common access control 
deterrents used in the cybersecurity world.

Data Masking
Data masking technology secures data by replacing sensitive 
information with a non-sensitive version. The non-sensitive 
version looks and acts like the original. This means that a 
business process can use non-sensitive data and there is no need 
to change the supporting applications or data storage facilities.

A cryptographic hash function has the following properties:
The input can be any length.
The output has a fixed length.
The hash function is one way and is not reversible.
Two different input values will almost never result in the same hash values

Salting
Salting makes password hashing more secure. If two users have the 
same password, they will also have the same password hashes. A 
salt, which is a random string of characters, is an additional 
input to the password before hashing. This creates 
a different hash result for the two passwords

Lookup Tables
A lookup table stores the pre-computed hashes of passwords in a 
password dictionary along with the corresponding password. A 
lookup table is a data structure that processes hundreds of hash 
lookups per second.

Reverse Lookup Tables
This attack allows the cybercriminal to launch a dictionary or 
brute-force attack on many hashes without the pre-computed lookup 
table. The cybercriminal creates a lookup table that plots each 
password hash from the breached account database to a list of 
users. The cybercriminal hashes each password guess and uses the 
lookup table to get a list of users whose password matched the 
cybercriminal’s guess

Rainbow Tables
Rainbow tables sacrifice hash-cracking speed to make the lookup 
tables smaller. A smaller table means that the table can store 
the solutions to more hashes in the same amount of space.

Digital Signature
A digital signature is a mathematical method used to check the 
authenticity and integrity of a message, digital document, or 
software. A digital signature can determine if someone edits a 
document after the user signs it. 

Code signing
Code signing - Used to verify the integrity of executable files 
downloaded from a vendor website. Code signing also uses signed 
digital certificates to authenticate and verify the identity of 
the site.

Digital certificates
Digital certificates - Used to verify the identity of an 
organization or individual to authenticate a vendor website and 
establish an encrypted connection to exchange confidential data.

Network Operation Center (NOC)
The Network Operation Center (NOC) is one or more locations 
containing the tools that provide administrators with a detailed 
status of the organization’s network. The NOC is ground zero for 
network troubleshooting, performance monitoring, software 
distribution and updates, communications management, and device 
management.

Security Operation Center (SOC) 
The Security Operation Center (SOC) is a dedicated site that 
monitors, assesses, and defends the organization’s information 
systems such as websites, applications, databases, data centers, 
networks, servers, and user systems. A SOC is a team of security 
analysts who detect, analyze, respond to, report on, and prevent 
cybersecurity incidents.


AAA Standard
AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. 
AAA provides the primary framework to set up access control 
on a network device. AAA is a way to control who is permitted 
to access a network (authenticate), what they can do while 
they are there (authorize), and to audit what actions they 
performed while accessing the network (accounting).
